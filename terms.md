Git Terminology
===============

Refer to this document when you come across a term in the man pages you do not
know.

Branches
--------

A branch is a named collection of commits. A very common scenario is to switch
to a new branch for a new feature, leaving your master branch unaffected by the
new feature addition until you explicitly merge the new feature branch with
your master branch. This is extremely useful since production bugs may be found
while developing a feature, and debugging the issue with an increased
complexity caused by the new, unfinished feature leads to an unpleasant
experience.

Commit
------

A commit is a collection of file additions, modifications, and deletions.  A
commit message describes the collection of file modifications for humans, such
as "Added README", or "Fixed memory allocation bug".
