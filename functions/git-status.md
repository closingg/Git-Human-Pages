git status
==========

Human Summary
-------------
View a list of files that have one of the following properties:

    * is currently untracked by git (and not ignored)
    * has been changed since the last commit
    * has been changed since the last commit AND is staged(*) to be commited
    * was previously staged but has since been modified

```git status``` is *extremely* useful to see what you're about to commit.

(*) See "Index/Staging Area" in the terms file. 

Usage
-----

Suppose ```myfile.txt``` and ```README.md``` are currently versioned under git.
If ```myfile.txt``` is modified,  ```git-status``` will show the following:

    # Changes not staged for commit:
    #   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #       modified:   myfile.txt
    # 

All files listed under "Changes not staged for commit" will not have their
modifications added to the next commit. We must use ```git add``` to add the
file modifications to the next commit. If we were to run

    $ git add myfile.txt
    $ git status

We would see the following:

    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #       modified:   myfile.txt
    #

All files listed under "Changes to be committed" **will** have their
modifications added to the next commit.

If we were then to add a ```brandnewfile.txt```, we would see the following upon
running ```git status```:

    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #       modified:   myfile.txt
    #
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #       brandnewfile.txt

All files listed under "Untracked files" are files currently not versioned
under git that have not been ignored via ```.gitignore```. You must use 
```git add``` to begin tracking these files.

Finally, if we were to modify both ```README.md``` (previously unmodified) and
```myfile.txt``` (previously modified and staged to be committed), ```git
status``` would show us the following:

    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #       modified:   myfile.txt
    #
    # Changes not staged for commit:
    #   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #       modified:   README.md
    #       modified:   myfile.txt
    # 
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #       brandnewfile.txt


The two occurences of ```modified:  myfile.txt``` lets us know that just
because we added ```myfile.txt``` to the staging area before does not mean any
subsequent changes to the file will also be commited. We must once again run

    $ git add myfile.txt
 
Then ```git status``` will show us the following (note the absence of
```myfile.txt``` in the "Changes not staged for commit" section.)

    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #       modified:   myfile.txt
    #
    # Changes not staged for commit:
    #   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #       modified:   README.md
    # 
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #       brandnewfile.txt

Suppose we commit our changes and view the status immediately afterward.

    $ git commit -m "Update documents"
    $ git status
    # On branch master
    nothing to commit (working directory clean)

The working directory is now clean (there have been no changes since the last
commit).

Further Uses
------------

### -s, --short

Provides a more condensed output. Example output:

    $ git-status -s
    MM myfile.txt
    M  README.md
    ?? brandnewfile.txt

Here's a table for the possible symbols to the left of the file names:

    ?? Untracked file
     M Modification not staged for commit
    M  Modification staged for commit
    MM Modifications staged for commit, but also contains unstaged changes
     D File deletion not staged for commit
    D  File deletion staged for commit
    A  File addition staged for commit


 

Technical Summary
-----------------
Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current
HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index
file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by git (and are not
ignored by gitignore)
